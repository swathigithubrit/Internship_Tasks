1️⃣ For loop vs While loop

✅ For Loop

Answer:

> A for loop is used when the number of iterations is known in advance. It is commonly used with sequences like lists, strings, or `range()`.

Example:

```python
for i in range(1, 6):
    print(i)
```

Use cases:

* Traversing lists or strings
* Fixed number of repetitions
* Reading data row by row

---

✅ While Loop

Answer:

> A while loop is used when the number of iterations is not known, and the loop depends on a condition.

Example:

```python
count = 5
while count > 0:
    print(count)
    count -= 1
```

Use cases:

* Login attempts
* Countdown timers
* Waiting for user input

---

🔑 Key Difference (one-liner)

> Use for loop when iterations are fixed, and while loop when iterations depend on a condition.

---

2️⃣ When to use `break`?

✅ Answer:

> The `break` statement is used to terminate a loop immediately when a specific condition is met.

Example:

```python
for num in range(1, 10):
    if num == 5:
        break
    print(num)
```

Real-world example:

* Stop searching once the item is found
* Exit loop after successful login

Interview tip:

> `break` improves efficiency by stopping unnecessary iterations.

---

## 3️⃣ What is an Infinite Loop?

### ✅ Answer:

> An infinite loop is a loop that never stops executing because its condition always remains true.

Example (wrong code):

```python
while True:
    print("Running forever")
```

Another example:

```python
i = 1
while i <= 5:
    print(i)
```

(Here `i` is never updated)

---

⚠️ Why infinite loops are dangerous?

* High CPU usage
* Application freeze
* System crash

✅ How to avoid?

* Update loop variables
* Use `break` condition
* Validate exit condition

4️⃣ What is `range()`?

### ✅ Answer:

> `range()` is a built-in Python function that generates a sequence of numbers used mainly in loops.

### Syntax:

```python
range(start, stop, step)
```

### Examples:

```python
range(5)        # 0 to 4
range(1, 6)     # 1 to 5
range(1, 10, 2) # Odd numbers
```

Example in loop:

```python
for i in range(1, 6):
    print(i)
```

5️⃣ Loop Optimization Techniques 

✅ Answer:

> Loop optimization techniques are used to reduce execution time and improve performance.

---

1. Use `break` to stop early

```python
for num in data:
    if num == target:
        break
```

---

2. Avoid unnecessary loops

❌ Bad:

```python
for i in range(len(arr)):
    print(arr[i])
```

✅ Good:

```python
for item in arr:
    print(item)
```

---

3. Use built-in functions

```python
total = sum(numbers)
```

instead of manual loop.

---

4. Reduce repeated calculations

❌ Bad:

```python
for i in range(len(data)):
    print(len(data))
```

✅ Good:

```python
n = len(data)
for i in range(n):
    print(n)
```

---

5. Use `range()` properly

```python
for i in range(0, 100, 5):
    print(i)
```

One-Minute Rapid Answers (Revise Before Interview)

* For loop → Fixed iterations
* While loop → Condition-based
* Break → Exit loop immediately
* Infinite loop → Loop without exit
* Range → Number sequence generator
* Optimization → Faster, efficient execution
