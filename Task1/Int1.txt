1. How does Python execution start?

Python execution starts when the Python interpreter reads the source code file line by line from the top.
The interpreter first checks the syntax, then converts the code into bytecode, and finally executes it using the Python Virtual Machine (PVM).
Execution begins from the first line of the program, unless functions or classes are defined, which run only when they are called.

2. Difference between compiled and interpreted languages

| Compiled Language                                   | Interpreted Language                               |
| --------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Entire code is translated into machine code at once | Code is executed line by line                      |
| Requires a compiler (e.g., C, C++)                  | Requires an interpreter (e.g., Python, JavaScript) |
| Faster execution after compilation                  | Slower execution compared to compiled              |
| Errors shown after compilation                      | Errors shown during execution                      |
| Platform-dependent binaries                         | Platform-independent                               |

Python is an interpreted language.

3. What is the role of an IDE?

An IDE (Integrated Development Environment) helps developers write, run, debug, and manage code efficiently.
It provides features like:

* Code editor
* Syntax highlighting
* Auto-completion
* Error detection
* Debugging tools
* Integrated terminal

Examples: VS Code, PyCharm, Eclipse

4. How do comments help in real projects?

Comments help in:

* Explaining the purpose of code
* Making code easy to understand
* Helping other developers read and maintain code
* Debugging and future modifications
* Improving teamwork and documentation

Comments are ignored by the Python interpreter during execution.

5. How do you take user input in Python?

User input in Python is taken using the `input()` function.

Example:

```python
name = input("Enter your name: ")
print("Hello", name)
```

The `input()` function always returns string data, so type conversion is required when working with numbers.
