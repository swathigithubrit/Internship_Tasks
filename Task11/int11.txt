1️⃣ What are Regular Expressions (Regex)?
Interview Answer

Regular Expressions (regex) are patterns used to search, match, extract, or validate text based on specific rules.

Why regex exists

To avoid writing long conditional logic

To handle complex string patterns efficiently

To validate inputs like email, phone number, password, etc.

Simple Example (Python)
import re

pattern = r'\d+'
text = "Order ID is 12345"

result = re.search(pattern, text)
print(result.group())


Output:

12345


Here:

\d+ → matches digits

Regex finds numbers inside text easily

2️⃣ Difference between match, search, and findall
Interview Answer

These methods differ in where and how they search for a pattern.

Comparison Table

| Method      | Description                                  |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `match()`   | Checks match **only at beginning** of string |
| `search()`  | Finds first match **anywhere** in string     |
| `findall()` | Returns **all matches** as a list            |


Example
import re

text = "My number is 9876543210"

print(re.match(r'\d+', text))       # None
print(re.search(r'\d+', text))      # Match object
print(re.findall(r'\d+', text))     # ['9876543210']

Key Interview Line

match() is strict, search() is flexible, and findall() is exhaustive.

3️⃣ Why is Regex Preferred for Validation?
Interview Answer

Regex is preferred for validation because it allows complex pattern checking in a single line, making code cleaner, faster, and more reliable.

Why not normal if-else?

Multiple conditions → messy code

Hard to maintain

Error-prone

Example: Email Validation

❌ Without Regex:

if "@" in email and "." in email:
    pass


✅ With Regex:

re.fullmatch(r'^[\w.-]+@[\w.-]+\.\w+$', email)

Interview Advantage

Regex ensures format correctness, not just character presence.

4️⃣ What are Greedy and Non-Greedy Patterns?
Interview Answer

Greedy patterns match as much text as possible, while
non-greedy (lazy) patterns match as little text as possible.

🔹 Greedy Example
import re

text = "<tag>content</tag>"
print(re.search(r'<.*>', text).group())


Output:

<tag>content</tag>


➡ .* eats everything

🔹 Non-Greedy Example
print(re.search(r'<.*?>', text).group())


Output:

<tag>


➡ .*? stops at first match

Interview One-Liner

Adding ? makes a greedy quantifier non-greedy.

5️⃣ Real-World Use Cases of Regex
Interview Answer

Regex is widely used for input validation, data extraction, text processing, and security checks.

Common Real-World Applications

| Use Case        | Example                    |
| --------------- | -------------------------- |
| Form validation | Email, password, phone     |
| Log analysis    | Extract timestamps, errors |
| Data cleaning   | Remove special characters  |
| Web scraping    | Extract URLs, IDs          |
| Search engines  | Pattern matching           |
| Security        | Input sanitization         |


Example: Log File Parsing
log = "ERROR 2024-01-01 Database failure"
re.findall(r'\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2}', log)


Output:

['2024-01-01']
