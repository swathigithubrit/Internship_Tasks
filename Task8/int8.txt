Why use with statement?

Automatically closes files even if an exception occurs.

🔹 File modes:

"w" → Write (overwrites)

"r" → Read

"a" → Append

"w+" → Write + Read

🔹 Why newline="" in CSV?

Prevents extra blank lines in Windows.



1️⃣ File Modes in Python

File modes define how a file is opened and what operations are allowed (read, write, append, etc.).

Common File Modes:

| Mode   | Meaning                            |
| ------ | ---------------------------------- |
| `"r"`  | Read (file must exist)             |
| `"w"`  | Write (creates or overwrites file) |
| `"a"`  | Append (adds data at end)          |
| `"x"`  | Create file, fails if exists       |
| `"r+"` | Read + Write                       |
| `"w+"` | Write + Read (overwrites)          |
| `"a+"` | Append + Read                      |
| `"b"`  | Binary mode                        |
| `"t"`  | Text mode (default)                |


Example code :- 

with open("data.txt", "w") as file:
    file.write("Hello World")


one-liner:

File modes control how and where data flows in a file.



2️⃣ Why Should We Close Files?


Files should be closed to free system resources, prevent data loss, and avoid file locking issues.

What happens if you don’t close?

Data may not be saved

Memory leak

File remains locked

OS resource exhaustion


Example (bad practice):


file = open("data.txt", "w")
file.write("Hello")
# file not closed ❌


Correct approach:

with open("data.txt", "w") as file:
    file.write("Hello")
# file auto-closed ✅


one-liner:

Closing a file commits data and releases resources.



3️⃣ CSV Use Cases
Interview-style answer:

CSV files are used to store tabular data in a simple, portable format that can be easily shared between systems.

Common Real-World Use Cases:

Excel reports

Student records

Financial transactions

Machine learning datasets

Data migration between systems

Example:

ID,Name,CGPA
101,Swathi,8.7
102,Anil,8.3


Why CSV is popular:

Human-readable

Lightweight

Supported by almost all tools

One-liner:

CSV is the bridge between databases, spreadsheets, and programs.



4️⃣ What is a Context Manager?

A context manager is an object that automatically manages resources, ensuring setup and cleanup actions are performed properly.

In file handling:

Opens file at start

Closes file automatically

Example:

with open("data.txt", "r") as file:
    print(file.read())


Without context manager:

file = open("data.txt", "r")
print(file.read())
file.close()


one-liner:

Context managers prevent resource leaks.



5️⃣ File Handling Errors

File handling errors occur due to missing files, permission issues, or invalid operations.

Common File-Related Errors:


| Error               | Meaning                  |
| ------------------- | ------------------------ |
| `FileNotFoundError` | File doesn’t exist       |
| `PermissionError`   | Access denied            |
| `IOError`           | Input/output error       |
| `IsADirectoryError` | Directory opened as file |
| `ValueError`        | Invalid file operation   |


Example:

try:
    with open("missing.txt", "r") as file:
        print(file.read())
except FileNotFoundError:
    print("File not found.")


one-liner:

File errors occur due to environment or access issues.


Final Sheet

File modes → control access

Close files → avoid leaks & data loss

CSV → simple tabular data

Context manager → automatic cleanup

File errors → handle with try-except


Why close files? → To free resources

Why with? → Auto close files

CSV vs JSON? → Table vs structured data

Most common file error? → FileNotFoundError



1️⃣ Difference between read(), readline(), readlines()
Interview-style answer:

All three are used to read data from a file, but they differ in how much data they read and how they return it.

Comparison Table:

| Method | What it reads | Return type | Memory usage |
|------|---------------|-------------|
| read() | Entire file | str | High |
| readline() | One line at a time | str | Low |
| readlines() | All lines | list | Medium |


Examples:
read()
with open("data.txt", "r") as f:
    content = f.read()
    print(content)


✔ Reads complete file
❌ Not suitable for very large files



readline()
with open("data.txt", "r") as f:
    line = f.readline()
    print(line)


✔ Reads one line at a time
✔ Best for large files


readlines()
with open("data.txt", "r") as f:
    lines = f.readlines()
    print(lines)


✔ Reads all lines into a list
✔ Useful for line-based processing


one-liner:

read() reads all, readline() reads one, readlines() reads many.

2️⃣ What happens if a file doesn’t exist?
Interview-style answer:

If a file does not exist, Python’s behavior depends on the file mode.

Behavior by file mode:

| Mode  | Result                             |
| ----- | ---------------------------------- |
| `"r"` | `FileNotFoundError` ❌              |
| `"w"` | Creates new file ✅                 |
| `"a"` | Creates new file ✅                 |
| `"x"` | Error if file exists, else creates |




Example:
open("missing.txt", "r")   # ❌ FileNotFoundError
open("new.txt", "w")       # ✅ Creates file

Proper handling:
try:
    with open("missing.txt", "r") as f:
        print(f.read())
except FileNotFoundError:
    print("File not found")

One-liner:

Read mode expects file to exist.



3️⃣ Difference between CSV and JSON

CSV is used for tabular data, while JSON is used for structured and hierarchical data.

Comparison Table:

| Feature             | CSV            | JSON            |
| ------------------- | -------------- | --------------- |
| Data format         | Rows & columns | Key-value pairs |
| Structure           | Flat           | Nested          |
| Human readability   | High           | High            |
| Used in APIs        | ❌              | ✅               |
| Used in ML datasets | ✅              | ❌               |



Example:
CSV:
ID,Name,CGPA
101,Swathi,8.7
102,Anil,8.3

JSON:
{
  "id": 101,
  "name": "Swathi",
  "cgpa": 8.7
}


One-liner:

CSV is for tables, JSON is for data exchange.



4️⃣ How file handling is used in real projects

File handling is used in real projects for data storage, configuration, logging, reporting, and integration.

Real-World Use Cases:
🔹 Configuration Management
{
  "db": "mysql",
  "port": 3306
}


✔ App reads config file at startup

🔹 Logging
with open("app.log", "a") as log:
    log.write("User logged in\n")


✔ Used for debugging and audits

🔹 Data Processing & ML

Read CSV datasets

Save trained models

Export results

🔹 Reports & Exports

Generate CSV reports

Save PDF summaries

Backup user data

🔹 APIs & Integration

Read JSON responses

Write JSON requests

Store API responses

Interview one-liner:

File handling connects code with persistent storage.

⭐ Final Interview Cheat Sheet

read() → full file

readline() → one line

readlines() → list of lines

Missing file → depends on mode

CSV vs JSON → table vs structure

Real use → configs, logs, data, reports
