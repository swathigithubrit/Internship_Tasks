1️⃣ What is OOP (Object-Oriented Programming)?

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that organizes code into objects, where each object represents a real-world entity and contains data (attributes) and behavior (methods).

Why it exists

To model real-world problems

To improve code reusability

To make applications scalable and maintainable

Simple Example (Python)
class Car:
    def __init__(self, brand):
        self.brand = brand

    def drive(self):
        print(self.brand, "is driving")

car1 = Car("Toyota")
car1.drive()


Here:

Car → real-world entity

brand → data

drive() → behavior



2️⃣ What is Encapsulation?
Interview Answer

Encapsulation is the concept of hiding internal data and allowing access only through controlled methods.

Why it is needed

Protects sensitive data

Prevents accidental modification

Improves security

Real-World Example

ATM machine:

You cannot directly access balance

You use options like withdraw, deposit

Code Example
class BankAccount:
    def __init__(self, balance):
        self._balance = balance  # protected variable

    def get_balance(self):
        return self._balance


You don’t access _balance directly → you use get_balance().



3️⃣ What is Inheritance? Give an example.
Interview Answer

Inheritance allows one class (child) to reuse the properties and methods of another class (parent).

Why it is useful

Code reusability

Avoids duplication

Logical hierarchy

Real-World Example

Vehicle → Car, Bike

BankAccount → SavingsAccount

Code Example
class Vehicle:
    def move(self):
        print("Vehicle is moving")

class Car(Vehicle):
    def drive(self):
        print("Car is driving")

c = Car()
c.move()   # inherited method
c.drive()


Here:

Car inherits from Vehicle




4️⃣ What is Polymorphism?
Interview Answer

Polymorphism means one method behaving differently based on the object calling it.

Simple meaning

Same function name → different behavior

Real-World Example

Withdraw in:

Savings account (minimum balance rule)

Current account (overdraft allowed)

Code Example (Method Overriding)
class Animal:
    def sound(self):
        print("Animal makes sound")

class Dog(Animal):
    def sound(self):
        print("Dog barks")

a = Dog()
a.sound()


Same method sound() → different output.




5️⃣ Why OOP over Procedural Programming?
Interview Answer

OOP is preferred over procedural programming because it provides better structure, reusability, scalability, and maintainability, especially for large applications.

Comparison Table

| Feature             | Procedural | OOP                  |
| ------------------- | ---------- | -------------------- |
| Structure           | Functions  | Classes & Objects    |
| Data Security       | Poor       | High (Encapsulation) |
| Reusability         | Low        | High                 |
| Maintenance         | Difficult  | Easy                 |
| Real-world modeling | Weak       | Strong               |



Example
Procedural
balance = 5000

def withdraw(amount):
    global balance
    balance -= amount

OOP
class Account:
    def __init__(self, balance):
        self.balance = balance

    def withdraw(self, amount):
        self.balance -= amount


OOP keeps data + logic together, making code safer.
