1. What is dynamic typing?

Dynamic typing means that Python does not require us to declare the data type of a variable explicitly.
The data type is decided at runtime based on the value assigned to the variable, and the same variable can change its type during execution.

Example:

```python
x = 10      # x is int
x = "Hi"    # x is now string
```

2. Difference between int and float

| int                   | float                      |
| --------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Stores whole numbers  | Stores decimal numbers     |
| Examples: 5, 100, -20 | Examples: 3.14, 2.5, -0.99 |
| Uses less memory      | Uses more memory           |
| Faster operations     | Slightly slower than int   |

Example:

```python
a = 10      # int
b = 10.5    # float
```

3. Why is type conversion required?

Type conversion is required when data needs to be converted from one type to another so that operations can be performed correctly.
For example, user input is always read as a string, but arithmetic operations require numeric types like int or float.

Example:

```python
age = int(input("Enter age: "))
```

---

4. What happens if conversion fails?

If type conversion fails, Python raises a runtime error such as `ValueError`.
This usually happens when invalid data is converted, like converting a string that does not contain a number into an integer.

Example:

```python
int("abc")  # ValueError
```

To avoid crashes, exception handling (try-except) is used.

5. How does Python store variables in memory?

In Python, variables do not store values directly.
Instead, they store references (memory addresses) to objects stored in memory.
Multiple variables can point to the same object, and Python automatically manages memory using garbage collection.

Example:

```python
a = 10
b = a
```

Here, both `a` and `b` refer to the same memory object.
