1️⃣ Difference between `if` and `elif`:

* `if` is used to check a condition for the first time.
* `elif` (short for “else if”) is used to check another condition only if the previous `if` or `elif` was False.
* Only one block of `if-elif-else` executes; once a condition is True, Python skips the rest.

Example:

```python
marks = 85

if marks >= 90:
    print("A+ Grade")
elif marks >= 80:
    print("A Grade")  # This will execute
else:
    print("B Grade")
```



2️⃣ What are logical operators?

* Logical operators allow combining multiple conditions.
* Python has three main logical operators:

  1. `and` → True if both conditions are True
  2. `or` → True if any one condition is True
  3. `not` → Inverts the result

Example:

```python
marks = 75
attendance = 90

# Student passes if marks >= 50 AND attendance >= 75
if marks >= 50 and attendance >= 75:
    print("Pass")
```

3️⃣ How does Python evaluate conditions?

* Python evaluates conditions from left to right in `if` statements.
* It checks Boolean value (`True` or `False`) of each expression.
* Once a condition is True, Python executes its block and skips the rest.

Example:

```python
marks = 65

if marks > 80:
    print("A Grade")
elif marks > 60:
    print("C Grade")  # Python executes this block
else:
    print("Fail")
```

---

4️⃣ What is nesting?

* Nesting means putting one `if` or `else` block **inside another.
* Useful for complex business rules.
* Example: special rules within a grade.

Example:

```python
marks = 55

if marks >= 50:
    if marks == 55:
        print("C+ Grade (Just Passed)")  # Nested condition
    else:
        print("C Grade")
else:
    print("Fail")
```

---

5️⃣ How to avoid deep nesting?

* Too many nested `if` statements make code hard to read.
* Use these strategies:

  1. Return early in functions
  2. Use logical operators (`and`, `or`) to combine conditions
  3. Refactor code into functions

Example (avoid deep nesting):

```python
def grade(marks):
    if marks < 0 or marks > 100:
        return "Invalid marks"
    if marks >= 90:
        return "A+ Grade"
    if marks >= 80:
        return "A Grade"
    if marks >= 70:
        return "B Grade"
    if marks >= 60:
        return "C Grade"
    return "Fail"

print(grade(85))
```

✅ Notice: No deep nesting, and the logic is clear and readable.
